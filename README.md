# Hungarian  algorithm 
The Hungarian algorithm for the assignment problem computes the optimization matrix, the code has been optimized according to the relevant journals

After the algorithm runs, only the optimal matrix is obtained, and the required independent zero-tuples need to be manually extracted.

The input order is
1. Input the order of the square matrix (including the virtual matrix).
2. Input the number of matrix rows excluding the virtual matrix.
3. The input does not include the number of matrix columns of the dummy matrix.
4. Input square matrices (including virtual matrices)

Make sure that the matrix you enter is the one you want to compute directly with the Hungarian algorithm
