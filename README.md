# Hungarian  algorithm 
The Hungarian algorithm for the assignment problem computes the optimization matrix, the code has been optimized according to the relevant journals

Please adjust the range and n value of the array in the global variable according to the order of the matrix before use.

After the algorithm runs, only the optimal matrix is obtained, and the required independent zero-tuples need to be manually extracted.
